Underwater swarm robots simulation through software
**Robotics Underwater Swarm Robots**

_**Project Overview**__

This repository contains the implementation and simulations for a multi-agent underwater swarm robotic system. The project focuses on autonomous underwater robots capable of cooperative behavior for various underwater tasks, including exploration, mapping, and environmental monitoring.

_**Features**_

Multi-robot coordination and communication

Autonomous navigation and obstacle avoidance

Target identification and cooperative manipulation

Adaptive behavior in dynamic underwater environments

Real-time position tracking and path planning

_**Simulation & Visualization**_

Time-step based simulation for monitoring robot positions

Graphical representation of robots' paths, targets, and obstacles

Performance metrics for swarm efficiency and task completion

_**Technologies Used**_

Python for simulation and control algorithms

Matplotlib for plotting robot paths and behavior

ROS (Robot Operating System) for control architecture

Gazebo for 3D simulation (optional)

_**Getting Started**_

Clone the repository

_**The output video of the simulation is:**_

1.The black moving squares are the moving obstacles in water ( like fishes & underwater animals )
2.The triangle are the static obstacles ( like corals & coral reefs ) 
3.The moving leader follower robots are underwater swarm robots that have a radius senstive server for the static and dynamic obstacles based on that they avoid those 
  obstacles and move away from the obstacles
